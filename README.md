# PyComplete

An autocomplete tool written in python. 

## Thoughts
I'd need
- [ ] A Trie structure to autocomplete the current word typed
    - [ ] Figure closest complete word (leaf) to current letter (node) (BFS) 
- [ ] A first-order Markov chain to predict the next word based on the likeliest word
